## 2024-05-22 - [Synchronous LocalStorage & String Concatenation]
**Learning:** This app uses `localStorage` for potentially large datasets and generates UI via massive string concatenation in `storage.js`.
**Action:** Always look for caching opportunities in `Storage` methods (like `renderLibraryHTML`) to avoid repeated expensive serialization/deserialization and string operations on the main thread.

## 2024-05-23 - [Render Cache Optimization]
**Learning:** Caching the final joined HTML string in `Storage` reduces render time from O(N) to O(1).
**Action:** When managing list rendering with incremental updates (`unshift`/`push`), update the cached HTML string incrementally instead of rebuilding it entirely.
