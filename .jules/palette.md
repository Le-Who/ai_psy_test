## 2026-02-01 - [Form Validation & Feedback]
**Learning:** Standard HTML5 `required` attribute allows whitespace, which can lead to empty submissions. Replacing intrusive `alert()` calls with Toasts and focus management creates a much smoother flow.
**Action:** Always combine `required` attributes with explicit JS validation (`.trim()`) for text inputs, and use visual indicators (asterisks) to make expectations clear upfront.

## 2024-05-21 - [Accessible Glassmorphism Menus]
**Learning:** For glassmorphism menus implemented with `div`s, replacing them with semantic `<button`> tags plus a CSS reset (`background: transparent; border: none; text-align: left`) is the most robust way to add accessibility without breaking the visual design.
**Action:** Use the `.theme-opt` CSS reset pattern for any new interactive list items in the design system.

## 2025-05-23 - [Input Group Styling]
**Learning:** Global styles on inputs (like `margin-top`) can break layout when wrapping inputs for icons.
**Action:** Move spacing properties to the wrapper container (`.input-group`) and reset them on the child input.

## 2025-05-23 - [Dynamic Button States]
**Learning:** When a button's visual text changes to convey a new state (like "Delete" -> "Confirm?"), the `aria-label` MUST update simultaneously. Screen reader users miss the context switch if the label remains static.
**Action:** Use `dataset` to store the original label, update `aria-label` during the confirmation state, and restore it on timeout or cancellation.

## 2023-10-26 - [Form Label Accessibility]
**Learning:** Adding labels to inputs isn't enough; they must be explicitly linked via `for` and `id` attributes. This ensures screen readers announce the input correctly and allows users to click the label text to focus the input field, which drastically improves interaction for both mouse and touch users.
**Action:** Always include a `for` attribute in `<label>` tags that corresponds exactly to their associated input's `id`.
